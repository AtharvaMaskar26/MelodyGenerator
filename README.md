## Introduction
HarmonAI is a deep learning-based melody generator built using RNN & LSTM. It allows users to pass in a seed melody and temperature (randomness) to complete the melody ahead of that.


## Features
- Generate melodies based on a seed melody and temperature.
- Explore the creative possibilities of AI-generated music.
- Easy-to-use interface for melody generation.

## Future Scope
- Experiment with more Deep Learning models to compare the results. 
- Try transfomer based architecture. 

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository 
`git clone https://github.com/AtharvaMaskar26/harmon-ai.git`

### install dependencies 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the streamlit app 
`streamlit run app.py`


## Usage
- You can train the model for your own dataset using the `preprocess.py` and `train.py` files. 

- If you want to try different models, you can check out the code in `melodygenerator.py` file.
